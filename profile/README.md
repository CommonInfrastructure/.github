## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a Suggestion of a Github structure for Optimizely Common Infrastructure.


Each system that we buy/build/run is represented by a Repository.

In each repository there are folders for major components.

Under a component there could be additional folders and files as needed.

(Do NOT add any code to this org untill we agree on a shared structure!)
